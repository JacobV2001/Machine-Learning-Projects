# Fraud Detection ðŸš¨ðŸ’³
In today's society, where everyone makes purcashes and transactions through electronic means, it is increasingly easier for fraudulent activity to go unnoticed. As such, it is imperative that we create methods to **detect** and **prevent** these transactions. This project focuses on using machine learnign techniques to identify fraudulent activities with a high recall score. This approach allows for almost all fraudulent transactions are caught.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and scaled features. Handled class imbalance using SMOTE.
- **Model Selection**: Tested various models including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest.
- **Evaluation Focus**: Focused on maximizing **recall** over accuracy due to the high cost of mislabeling fraud as non-fraud.
- **Visualization**: Used confusion matrix and other metrics to evaluate model performance.

## Project Objectives
- Build a machine learning model that accurately detects fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset.
- Preprocess transaction data by scaling, encoding, and handling missing values.
- Improve model performance by focusing on recall to capture as many fraudulent transactions as possible.

## Results
- **Recall**: Achieved a recall of **99%**, indicating that the model was able to detect 99% of fraudulent transactions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: The confusion matrix clearly shows that the model successfully identifies fraudulent transactions while maintaining a balance between false positives and true positives.
  
### Model Performance
- The **XGBoost** model showed the highest recall, outperforming other models in terms of identifying fraudulent transactions.
  
## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, scaling features using MinMaxScaler, encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and addressing class imbalance with SMOTE.
- **Modeling**: Implementing multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using recall, confusion matrix, and ROC AUC to ensure high performance in detecting fraud.
- **Data Visualization**: Using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize data distributions, feature correlations, and model performance.

## Tools and Libraries Used
