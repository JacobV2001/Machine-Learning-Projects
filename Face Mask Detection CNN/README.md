# Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

**Face Mask Detection using CNN!** ðŸ˜·âœ¨ This project focuses on using a CNN to detect whether an individual is wearing a mask or not based on image dissection and classification. By using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, I built a model that discovers patterns by breaking down images into distinct features and assosiates them with either the "with mask" or "without mask" class.
