# Breast Cancer Prediction with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Breast Cancer Prediction using KNN!** ðŸŽ¯ðŸ’‰ This project focuses on predicting whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on features extracted from breast cancer cell measurements. By utilizing a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier, I built a model that leverages these features to predict tumor type, using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the data by removing unnecessary columns and encoding the labels.
- **Feature Scaling**: Applied **Z-score normalization** to ensure all features are on the same scale for the KNN model.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Utilized **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the number of features while retaining variance in the dataset.
- **Model Building**: Built a **K-Nearest Neighbors classifier** with hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance with **recall** as the primary metric to ensure accurate detection of malignant tumors.
- **Visualization**: Used PCA and KNN to visualize the decision boundaries for tumor classification.

## Project Objectives

- Build a **KNN classifier** to predict whether a breast tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on given features.
- Preprocess the data by encoding labels and applying feature scaling techniques.
- Optimize the model using **GridSearchCV** to find the best hyperparameters for KNN.
- Evaluate the model using **recall** as the key metric to minimize false negatives (missed malignant tumors).

## Results

- **Model Performance**: Achieved **95% accuracy** and **90% recall** for identifying malignant tumors, demonstrating the modelâ€™s ability to accurately detect cancerous cells.
- **PCA and KNN Visualization**: Visualized the decision boundaries of the KNN classifier using the first two principal components of the data.
